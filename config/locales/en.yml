      title_one: "What inspired you to make this project?"

      title_five: "Have you thought about your project's rewards?"

      title_six: "Is your video ready?"
      tip_six: "The video is the business card of your project. It's through it that the supporters will get in touch with your cause. So, take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD is recommended."
      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
      tip_seven: "It is important to plan strategically to mobilize networks and convince them to support your project, both before and during the period of project completion. We recommend distributing your work weekly with your network according to the proximity you achieve with your supporters."
