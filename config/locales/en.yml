      title_one: "What inspired you to make this project?"

      title_five: "Have you thought about the project rewards?"

      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
      tip_seven: "It is important to plan strategically to mobilize networks and convince them to support your project, both before and during the period of project completion. We recommend distributing your work weekly with your network according to the proximity you achieve with your supporters."
      title_eight: "How will the money be used?"
